I questioned absolutely everything that was default in the ITG2 theme.\" Indeed, it was a stark departure from other theming efforts of the time, and became an instant hit.\n\nLara is a world-class Pump It Up player, and has represented the US at WPF multiple times. Most recently, she has designed the UI for Rhythm Horizon."

Maybe players SHOULD be allowed to put whatever they want as the DisplayName in Editable.ini.  Maybe Simply Love SHOULDN'T do anything to keep string length in check. Who's really to say? Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the mines and arrows of Ride, or to take arms against a sea of memes, and by opposing what I am doing?"
